Let's clear one thing up first - I am a complete amateur at writing. Definitely at writing a blog, but in general, it's just not my strong point. This is most likely due to my background in Mathematics and Computer Science taking precedence over creative writing. Anyway, I hope some of the content I share helps someone out, and if not, well "c'est la vie".

# My Background

A little about me: I've been working in the tech industry for 5 years now, with the past 4 years as a Quantitative Developer at a bank in London. While I'm still relatively early in my career, I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projects spanning financial modeling, cloud infrastructure, and full-stack development.

My expertise centers around Python development, particularly in financial services. I've specialized in:

- **Python development** - Building risk models, APIs, and data processing pipelines
- **Azure cloud deployment** - Full-stack solutions with emphasis on scalable cloud architecture
- **Full-stack development** - From backend APIs to frontend dashboards
- **Financial modeling** - Credit risk, portfolio analysis, and regulatory reporting

Throughout my career, I've encountered countless technical challenges that required hours (sometimes days) of problem-solving. The solutions I've developed and the lessons I've learned along the way form the foundation of what I want to share here.

# Motivations for Writing

I'm starting this blog for two main reasons, one altruistic and one admittedly more selfish.

### Sharing Knowledge

Firstly, I hope some of my knowledge could be useful to other people. I think people shouldn't have to reinvent the wheel. If writing about something I've struggled with for hours or days can prevent someone else from experiencing the same pain, then this blog serves its purpose.

Whether it's debugging a tricky Azure deployment, optimizing a Python data pipeline, or navigating the complexities of financial modeling, I want to document the solutions and approaches that have worked for me.

### Learning in the Age of AI

The second reason is more personal and topical to our industry in 2025. Everything I do - professionally and personally, with and without code - is now impacted by AI in some way. Don't get me wrong, I love it. As someone who prides themselves on rapidly providing value to businesses and others, AI has accelerated my ability to deliver solutions.

However, there's a catch. Sometimes I create products and processes, then walk away feeling like I haven't truly learned as much as I should have. The knowledge feels surface-level. Instead of scouring Stack Overflow, wrestling with documentation, and engaging in forum discussions, I can simply ask an LLM for the answer.

By committing to write these blog posts without AI assistance (think of it like using film cameras in a digital world - deliberately analog), I'm forcing myself to:

- **Cement knowledge** - Articulating concepts in my own words reinforces understanding
- **Engage deeply** - Wrestling with explanations requires true comprehension
- **Improve communication** - Practice conveying technical concepts clearly
- **Retain learning** - The act of writing creates lasting memory

## What to Expect

This blog will cover the technical challenges I encounter in my day-to-day work, the solutions I develop, and the lessons learned along the way. Expect posts on Python development, Azure cloud services, financial modeling, and the occasional deep dive into problem-solving approaches.

The writing might not be perfect - remember, I'm an amateur - but it will be authentic, practical, and hopefully useful.

Let's see where this journey takes us.
