Let's clear one thing up first - I am a complete amateur at writing, definitely at writing a blog, but in general it is just not my strong point. This is most likely due to my background in Mathematics and Computer Science taking precedence over my creative writing. Anyway, I hope some of the content I share helps someone out, and if not, well "c'est la vie".

# My Background

A little about me. I have worked in the Tech industry for 5 years now - I know this isn't long in the grand scheme of things, but I have been a part of some massive shifts in the sector; from entire migrations to the cloud, to AI "taking over". The last 4 years I have been working as a Quantitative Developer in a Bank in London.

I have gained specialtise in python

# Motivations for Writing

- motivations
  - More selfish note, with AI writing and doing so much, feel this is a good outlet to learn
  - retanin knowledge and try to do something that actively engages me
  - Everything will be written (blog) wise without AI (kinda like using the film cameras - retro)
  - improve my writting conveyance of technical concepts
